The Perseus software platform supports biological and biomedical researchers in interpreting protein quantification, interaction and post-translational modification data. Perseus contains a comprehensive portfolio of statistical tools for high-dimensional omics data analysis covering normalization, pattern recognition, time-series analysis, cross-omics comparisons and multiple-hypothesis testing (for an overview see @fig-perseus). A machine learning module supports the classification and validation of patient groups for diagnosis and prognosis, and it also detects predictive protein signatures. Central to Perseus is a user-friendly, interactive workflow environment that provides complete documentation of computational methods used in a publication[@tyanova2016].

## Learn

-   Hands-on tutorials and theoretical lectures are available on the [MaxQuant youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKYzYTm1cnmc0CFAMhxDO8w).
-   Participate in our annual [MaxQuant summer school](http://summerschool.maxquant.de) to gain even deeper insights into MaxQuant and Perseus. Read the protocol-style book chapter ([@tyanova2018] on Perseus. 
- Join the discussion around Perseus and data analysis on the [perseus google group](https://groups.google.com/g/perseus-list) -- a great place to ask any question and get answers from the community.
