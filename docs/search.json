    "text": "MaxQuant is a proteomics software package designed for analyzing large mass-spectrometric data sets. It is specifically aimed at high-resolution MS data. Several labeling techniques as well as label-free quantification are supported. MaxQuant is freely available and can be downloaded from this site. The download includes the search engine Andromeda, which is integrated into MaxQuant as well as the viewer application for inspection of raw data and identification and quantification results. For statistical analysis of MaxQuant output, we offer the Perseus framework.\n\nDocumentation outline\nThis documentation is organized as a wiki, so if you find anything that is wrong or hard to understand, in most cases you can fix it yourself by creating a puul request.

    "text": "Modern software platforms enable the analysis of shotgun proteomics data in an automated fashion resulting in high quality identification and quantification results. Additional understanding of the underlying data can be gained with the help of advanced visualization tools that allow for easy navigation through large LC-MS/MS datasets potentially consisting of terabytes of raw data. The updated MaxQuant version has a map navigation component that steers the users through mass and retention time-dependent mass spectrometric signals. It can be used to monitor a peptide feature used in label-free quantification over many LC-MS runs and visualize it with advanced 3D graphic models. An expert annotation system aids the interpretation of the MS/MS spectra used for the identification of these peptide features.\nTo run MaxQuant with its Viewer module, you will need .NET framework 4.5.

    "text": "The descriptions and screenshots in this tutorial refer to the MaxQuant GUI around version 1.4.3.14 from August 2014.\nIn case you are a first time user you might be worried by the many options and parameters that one can set in the user interface. In that case we have good news for you. In almost all use cases the standard values of most parameters are fine and you only need to adjust a small number of factors. Typically there is only little information that you need to provide. Every parameter in the interface has context help which you obtain by hovering with the mouse pointer over the text string for this parameter. This documentation also has that information, and more.\nYou will have to tell MaxQuant where to find your raw data files and your fasta files, and which labels and digestion enymes you are using. 90% of the time that will be enough, and you can leave the rest of the bells and whistles on their default values. Of course, we are assuming you have successfully installed and started MaxQuant, and that you can find the Start button once you have finished entering the processing parameters (hint: look in the lower left corner of the GUI). Here is more detail on how to enter those four most important parameters:\n\nRaw data: Along the top of the GUI are six tabs. The first of these is Raw files. Select that tab, then click “Load” to open a browser where you can select the file containing your raw data. You can select any number of files. You can also select all the raw data files in a single folder by using the “Load folder” button. In the screen shot, two files have been loaded. (If you still have questions, there is a page that goes into details about the Raw Files tab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraw file tab\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels: The second tab is Group-specific parameters. You need to go there to specify your labels. The “Type” will usually be “Standard” (obviously), and the “Multiplicity” will be 1 for label-free quantification, 2 if you have light and heavy labels, and 3 if you have light, medium, and heavy. Any number of labels can be checked in the lists. In this example, the light sample is unlabeled and the heavy sample has been labeled with Arg10 and Lys8. (You can’t see them both without scrolling.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup-specific parameters\n\n\n\n\n\nEnzymes: Also under the Group-specific parameters tab, you should enter the “Enzyme” (one or more) with which you have digested your proteins. They can be moved from the list at the left and back with the arrow buttons, and the order changed with the “t” (to top), “u” (up one place), “d” (down one place), and “b” (to bottom) buttons. In this example, we used Trypsin/P.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenzymes\n\n\n\n\n\nFASTA: Finally you will need to go to the third tab, “Global parameters” to specify where to find the “Fasta files” (one or more) you want to use. The “Add file” button will open a file browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfasta file\n\n\n\n\nAfter you press the “Start” button, you can monitor the progress of the analysis under the fourth tab, Performance. A popup window saying ‘Done’ will appear when MaxQuant is finished. All result files will appear in the folder …\\combined\\txt as tab-delimited text files. A pdf document with a description of all columns in all tables will be written to …\\combined\\txt\\tables.pdf.\nThe fifth tab is the Viewer, used to examine the results of the analysis, which will be the topic of the viewer tutorial. All columns have interactive descriptions in the Viewer program. Just move the mouse over the beginning of the column title and click on the question mark that will appear.\nThe sixth and final tab is Andromeda configuration. Andromeda is the peptide search engine, which needs to know what modifications, proteases, and sequence databases to take into consideration. Almost all that you will ever need are pre-configured, but you can use the buttons under this tab to add more, if your experiment requires it.\nThat’s how easy it can be!"
