    "text": "Andromeda is a peptide search engine based on probabilistic scoring. On proteome data, Andromeda performs as well as Mascot, a widely used commercial search engine, as judged by sensitivity and specificity analysis based on target decoy searches.\nIt can handle data with arbitrarily high fragment mass accuracy, it is also able to assign and score complex patterns of post-translational modifications, such as highly phosphorylated peptides, and accommodates extremely large databases. Andromeda can function independently or integrated into MaxQuant. This combination enables analysis of large datasets on a desktop computer. Identification of co-fragmented peptides improves the number of identified peptides.\nTo run Andromeda, you will need .NET framework 4.5.\n\n1 Documentation outline\nThis documentation is organized as a wiki, so if you find anything that is wrong or hard to understand, please let us know.

If this is the case, we have good news for you. In almost all user cases the standard values of most parameters are fine and you only need to adjust a small number of factors. Typically there is only little information that you need to provide. Every parameter in the interface has context help which you obtain by hovering with the mouse pointer over the text string for this parameter. This documentation also has that information, and more.\nYou will have to tell MaxQuant where to find your raw data files and your fasta files, and which labels and digestion enzymes you are using. 90% of the time that will be enough, and you can leave the rest of the bells and whistles on their default values. Of course, we are assuming you have successfully installed and started MaxQuant, and that you can find the Start button once you have finished entering the processing parameters (hint: look in the lower left corner of the GUI).

Then a new row will be added at the end of the table and a new sequence database form will appear on the right hand side that can be edited.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Adding a new entry to database\n\n\nThen you just have to fill in the form by defining the fasta file that should be used, the parsing rule that should be applied to retrieve the identifiers, the source of the fasta file, the taxonomy and the organism name. To define the parsing rule regular expressions are used. A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern with a special syntax. A good general introduction can be found, as always, on Wikipedia. If you already know generally how regular expressions work, you may only need to glance at a this Quick Reference or at an even quicker Cheat Sheet. Also you don’t have to know the taxonomy of your organism, just type in the name and use the arrows in the taxonomy line and MaxQuant will complete the form.\nDon’t forget to click the “Modify table” button (Figure 4) when you’re done to transfer the changes you made in the form to the table on the left.
