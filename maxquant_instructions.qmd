MaxQuant is a proteomics software package designed for analyzing large mass-spectrometric data sets. It is specifically aimed at high-resolution MS data. Several labeling techniques as well as label-free quantification are supported. MaxQuant is freely available and can be downloaded from this site. The download includes the search engine [Andromeda](andromeda_instructions.html), which is integrated into MaxQuant as well as the [viewer](viewer_instructions.html) application for inspection of raw data and identification and quantification results. For statistical analysis of MaxQuant output, we offer the [Perseus](perseus_instructions.html) framework.
